ROADMAP
=======

There is no timeline associated with the following schedule.  Release
dates are dependent on user feedback, bugs I find while trying to
develop with pymnl, and the time I can find to implement fixes.  That said,
I would like to have the 1.0 release out before the end of 2011.

v0.1 - first release
        Alpha version to get initial feedback from other developers.
        Wild API changes allowed.

v0.5 - second release
        Beta version with more complete test cases and examples.  Include
        fixes for bugs reported by users.  Minimal API changes allowed.

v0.9 - third release
        Beta version.  Mostly complete.  Only vital API changes allowed.
        Mainly bug fixes between here and 1.0 release.

v1.0 - fourth release
        Stable version.  Fixed API.

Beyond the 1.0 release should only be 1.0.x point releases for bug fixes.
Unless some dramatic change is required for Python or Netlink changes,
there will not be a 2.0 release.
